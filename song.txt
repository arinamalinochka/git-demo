hope when you take that jump
you don't fear to fall
hope when the water rises
you build a wall

hope when the croud screams out
they sreaming your name
hope if everybody runs
you choose to stay

hope that you fall in love
and it hurt so bad
the only way you can know it
you give it all you had

and i hope that you don't suffer
but take the pane
hope when the moment comes
you'll say
